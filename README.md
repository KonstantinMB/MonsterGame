# MonsterGame
This is a little console game I made in order to learn about OOP and packages in Java.

It helped me to learn how to make libraries in Java and how to properly use Interfaces, Inheritance and Encapsulation!

If you want to run the game, you can copy the files from this path: PackageDemo\src\com\company\game , which are:

ISaveable - the interface
Main
Monster
Player
